Track your calorie intake to ensure you're in a surplus.\n* **Protein Intake:** Aim for 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.\n* **Carbohydrates:**  Provide energy for workouts. Choose complex carbs like brown rice, sweet potatoes, and whole-wheat bread.\n* **Healthy Fats:**  Essential for hormone production. Include sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil.\n* **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n* **Progressive Overload:**  Continuously challenge your muscles with progressively heavier weights and/or more reps in your bicep curls (and other exercises!).\n\nThis is just a sample plan.
